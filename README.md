Usage
Installing Mods

    Download Mods:
        Find compatible mods from trusted sources like CurseForge or Planet Minecraft.

    Place Mods in the Mods Folder:
        Place the downloaded mod .jar files into the mods/ folder located in your Minecraft directory (the one where minecraft.jar is located).

    Launch Minecraft:
        Once the mods are in the mods/ folder, open Minecraft using the Cubelines Modloader profile.
        The Modloader will automatically load and manage the installed mods.

Mod Configuration

    Some mods may have specific settings you can adjust.
    Configuration files are usually located in the config/ folder within your Minecraft directory.
    Open these files with a text editor to customize mod settings.

Mod Updates

    Automatic Updates:
        The Modloader provides an option to check for updates to both the loader and the installed mods.
    Manual Updates:
        To update a specific mod, visit the mod's official page (e.g., on CurseForge) and download the latest version, replacing the old .jar file in the mods/ folder.

Troubleshooting

    Minecraft Crashes on Launch:
        Ensure that all installed mods are compatible with the version of Minecraft you're running.
        Check the logs/ folder for error messages to help identify the problematic mod.
        Disable recently added mods to determine which one is causing the crash.

    Mods Not Showing Up:
        Verify that the mods are placed in the correct mods/ folder.
        Make sure you're using the correct Modloader profile when launching the game.

    Mod Compatibility Issues:
        Check mod documentation or forums to ensure that your installed mods are compatible with one another.
